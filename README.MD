# Computer architecture

As I was TA of Computer Computer architecture it was one of my responsibilities to create power point for the class, so it came to my mind to publish this power point so every one can use it.
this power point is in enlish and also translated to Farsi at the same time.
so feel free to use it to prepare for your exam.presention etc ...
here are some picture of how the slides are look like.
